Evolving neural networks in the browser!

Neat stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies which is a
technique for creating neural networks in 2002 by Ken Stanley. It is
a genetic programming algorithm that modifies the weights and the
topologies of the network.

My implementation makes a pool of genomes organized by species that
can be transformed into networks. These networks transform a vector
of inputs to vector of outputs.


## Example

[An example is included that evolves a genome!](http://tavistock.github.io/neat/examples/floppy)

Be warned it takes a few generations to stop hugging the roof!
